		<p> I am mechanical engineer that sometimes dabbles in some code. You can check out my
			<a href="https://github.com/ab12gu">github</a>.</p>
		<p> I am currently working full-time at Pentair and am simultaneously completing graduate school in Thermofluids.
			I could keep talking about my accomplishments on this page, but it would be better to just send you over to
			my <a href="https://github.com/ab12gu">resume</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/ab12gu">linkedin</a>.
