	<p> I am a robotics engineer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tW_ebhUeIA">Lam Research</a>! Although our company is quite large, I am in a small team spanning many projects. </p>

	<p>I mainly develop new software solutions for both our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIcxOGo7ieU">maintenance robot</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH8ekYJrFHs">instructional Android app</a>, but I also dabble in our mechanical hardware projects as well! </p>
