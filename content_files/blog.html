I originally was developing my blog to be on my personal webpage, but I started to appreciate the publicity of medium.com.

<br>
<br>
Check out my coding blog: <a href="https://medium.com/@abgup">https://medium.com/@abgup</a>

<br>
<br>
Check out my food blog: <a href="https://medium.com/@abgup-food">https://medium.com/@abgup-food</a>

<br>

I may come back to publishing only on my site as my interest peaks. The issue with medium is that it lacks many formatting options you gain from alternative markup languages such as markdown, html, latex, etc. However, the convenience and publicity prevents me from leaving its grasp.
